    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Applegarth Elementary School has a program
      in math which is made for students who are good at math. To get into this program, you have to qualify to a 
      test. If you qualify to take the test, there is a set date on when you are going to take this test. To get in
      you have to get a certain score of 92 or above on the test. Even if you get a 92 or above there are a few 
      more standards. Only if you get the score of 92 or above on the test and qualify for one of the two criteria
      (or both) you will qualify for the program. This program has a different math teacher. The students that are 
      in this program will learn advanced math. For example, if you are in 5th grade and you are in Accelerated 
      Math you will leave your classroom for one period and go to a different classroom. In that classroom, you 
      learn advanced math with other students that are also in Accelerated Math. 5th grade learns 6th grade math.
      This program continues on until middle school. The last chance to get into Acclerated Math is in middle 
      school in 7th grade.

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Applegarth Elementary School has a bunch 
      of different classes. Other than the normal classes. Applegarth has gym, music, library, & art classes.
      Everyone one takes these classes once in a week. Everyone has 2 days of gym. During gym, you play fun 
      games and activities. During music, you play some instruments, and sing, and learn new songs. In library, 
      you learn new facts and check out 2 books you want to borrow fro the school. During art, you make art and 
      learn about new artists. Other than these specials you can choose to do band or chorus. These are optional
      activities. For both chorus and band you have to go to school and hour early to practice before everyone 
      else starts coming in for the normal school day. During chorus you learn new songs and practice them for the 
      school concert. Before you start band, you have to choose an instrument to play. You learn new pieces of 
      music for the concert. Doing band takes away from your normal school day time because you have pullout 
      lessons to go to. These are the special classes we have in Applegarth Elementary School.
